### pyFR: Delayed Free Recall of Word Lists, Preliminary Cognitive Electrophysiology Study

#### Description
This dataset contains behavioral events and intracranial electrophysiological recordings from a delayed free recall task.  The experiment consists of participants studying a list of words, presented visually one at a time, completing simple arithmetic problems that function as a distractor, and then freely recalled the words from the just-presented list in any order.  The data was collected at clinical sites across the country as part of a collaboration with the Computational Memory Lab at the University of Pennsylvania.

This study was a preliminary cogntive electrophysiology study undertaken by the Computational Memory Lab, and is a predecessor to the following datasets: [FR1](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004789) & [CatFR1](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004809)

#### To Note
* The iEEG recordings are labeled either "monopolar" or "bipolar."  The monopolar recordings are referenced (typically a mastoid reference), but should always be re-referenced before analysis.  The bipolar recordings are referenced according to a paired scheme indicated by the accompanying bipolar channels tables.
* Each subject has a unique montage of electrode locations.  MNI and Talairach coordinates are provided when available.
